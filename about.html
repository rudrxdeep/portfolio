        <h2>Rudradeep Gupta</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there! I'm a third-year Computer Science student
          at Bengal Institute of Technology, passionate about leveraging
          technology to solve real-world problems and create meaningful impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since childhood, I have studied in boarding schools, first in
          Kurseong, West Bengal (St. Anthony's School and Reliance Residential
          school) and then in Chattarpur, Delhi (CSKM Public School). These
          places taught me a lot how to survive in every situation possible, a
          never giving up attitude, and a will to solve any difficult problems
          thrown at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since I was young, I've been fascinated by the power of
          technology to transform lives. This curiosity led me to pursue a
          degree in Computer Science, where I've gained hands-on experience in
          coding, web development, and data analysis. I thrive in environments
          that challenge me to think critically and creatively, whether it's
          developing a website or analyzing complex datasets.
        </p>
        <p>
          What excites me most about technology is its potential to drive
          innovation and positive change.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my strengths as a student is my ability to adapt quickly to new
          technologies and learn continuously. I'm always seeking opportunities
          to expand my skills, whether through online courses, youtube or
          projects . My goal is to merge my technical skills with my passion for
          social impact to create solutions that address pressing societal
          challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me exploring the
          outdoors, playing table tennis, or at the gym. These experiences
          outside the classroom have shaped my holistic approach to
          problem-solving and enriched my perspective as a student and future
          technologist.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm eager to connect with fellow students, mentors, and industry
          professionals who share my passion for technology and innovation.
          Let's collaborate, learn from each other, and make a difference
          through technology together!
